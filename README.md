# kenyan_counties

A simple application to convert [Kenyan_counties.json](https://gist.github.com/Aroniez/a6b4e380bc7b9abdf595470749fb68cc) format to the required format [myformat.json](https://github.com/DanitoA1/kenyan_counties/blob/master/src/myformat.json). Yeah it did just that... I couldn't imagine myself doing this manually the task wasn't exciting so I had to make it an exciting one by writing a few lines of code.
